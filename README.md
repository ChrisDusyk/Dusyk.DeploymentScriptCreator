# Deployment Script Creator
This is a WPF application that takes a list of SQL scripts and combines them into one big script. This is to help simplify database script deployment for large projects. This project was started when I found myself having to deploy 17 scripts across several databases.

## Framework
- Built on Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)
- .NET Framework 4.6.2
- [Microsoft Windows API Code Pack](https://github.com/aybe/Windows-API-Code-Pack-1.1)
- NLog

### Getting Started
